Well, I’m going to talk about a park in Shanghai. it is along the Huangpu River called "MiShi Du Park", which was developed from a useless ferry port. 

I happened to find it on my phone when I was looking for some places to go sight-seeing. It is bigger than I expected and there were even some farming fields in it. Sometimes, I notice some farmers working in the fields.

I use to go to this park alone on weekends. I enjoy the fresh air in the park, especially when I’m riding on the paths/lanes. It’s common to find so many people picnicking on the grass with their family members. 

There is a riverbank in the park and many people like fishing there. I tend to find a spot on bank to sit and watch the ships navigating up and down in the river. The wind is usually soft and cool and it can make me feel completely relaxed and comfortable. I would forget the cares of work and life.

It is a good resort for pleasure. I have recommended it to my friends and relatives.

Well, I would like to talk about Shanghai, the city where I live now. It is famous for its achievement of economic development. The first time I came to know Shanghai is by the picture of Shanghai Bund printed on the cover of my textbooks when I was in school.

It is located in the east of China and has a good climate condition in all seasons, especially it is not too cold in winter.  The living conditions are also great. Walking along the residential street, it is easy to access supermarkets and restaurants. 

However, what’s important to me is the park for cycling, and there are so many beautiful parks around. One of the parks I used to go to is called "MiShi Du Park", which is by the HuangPu River. It is bigger than normal, even there are several agricultural fields in it. 

I remember the last time I went there by bike. I enjoyed the fresh air so much while I was cycling on the lanes. When I reached the riverbank, I found so many people picnicking on the grass. They were so absorbed in the food and the view.  After I sat down on the bank, I stared at the ships moving up and down. I felt completely relaxed because all the cares of work and life were forgotten. 

I love going to this park and I love living in this city.

Describe a photo that makes you feel happy

And explain why it makes you feel happy

Well,  I am not good at photography, but I would like to take a photo whenever I encounter a beautiful scene. I would like to talk about a photo I took in a park a long time ago, which includes the blue sky, the white clouds and the busy river. This picture could remind me of the experience I had that day. 

The park is located along the HuangPu River, which was developed from a port.
I still remember that was a sunny day, and I enjoyed the fresh air so much while I was cycling on the paths. When I reached the riverbank, I found so many people picnicking on the grass. They were so absorbed in the food and the view. After I sat down, I stared at the ships moving up and down. I felt completely relaxed because all the cares of work and life were forgotten. I thought it was worth a picture, so I took out my phone and captured the moment.

It’s an unforgettable photo for me. I even set it as my phone’s wallpaper for a long time.

Well, I would like to talk about a painting I saw at a museum. The museum is very large and has many exhibits. But this painting impressed me a lot. It shows the blue sky, the white clouds and a busy river. It reminded me of a scene I once saw in a park.

The park is located along the HuangPu River, which was developed from a port.
I still remember that’s a sunny day, and I enjoyed the fresh air so much while I cycled on the paths. When I reached the riverbank, I found so many people picnicking on the grass. They were so absorbed in the food and the views. After I found a spot to sit, I stared at the ships navigating up and down in the river. The wind caressed my face slightly, and I felt completely relaxed and forgot about the pressures of work and daily life. At that moment, the sky was blue with a few clouds and the river was busy. All of these were similar with the artwork in the museum.

Actually, I don’t remember who created this artwork. But he did a impressive job.

Well, I would like to talk about a happy time I had with my nephew. He is 7 years old and active every day. 

I remember last funny time I stayed with him was in a park.
The is very big and along a river. I think it is a good place for pleasure, so I recommended it to my older brother. Soon later, We met in that park. He brought his family members, including my nephew. When we walked along the lanes, the little boy was riding his mini-bike ahead. In order to make fun, he let me try his mini-bike and chased after me excitedly. After a while,  we reached the riverbank, we found so many people picnicking on the grass. They were so absorbed in the food and the view. At that time, my nephew said he was hungry, but there were no shops around. So it’s funny that he was watching others eating eagerly. Then we found a spot to sit and watched the ships sailing up and down in the river. He was curious about the ships and keeping ask many funny questions. My brother and I were and answered his question casually.

Because his innocence and liveliness make me feel young.
