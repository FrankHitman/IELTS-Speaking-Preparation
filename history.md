Well, I’m interested in the history of the 20th century in China. There were 2 revolutions during that time, the Xinhai Revolution and the Socialist Revolution. The former ended the Qing Dynasty and the latter ended former in mainland China. 

During the reign/government of the Republic of China, many brilliant masters emerged in various disciplines such as HuShi, QianMu, ZhouShuRen, WangGuoWei. Some of them immersed themselves in academic research. Some of them dared to criticise the darkness of the society or the regime, such corruption. By contrast, I don’t think there are as many brave and professional intellectuals now as there used to be. It might be because people are busy for making money or seeking fame, or because there is a lack of freedom of speech in current time, or maybe because of lack of democracy. 

I wonder if the history is making progress all the time or not. Why most people in today’s society don’t feel happy and satisfied. I’m curious about the reasons for these phenomena so I want to find the answers in the history.
