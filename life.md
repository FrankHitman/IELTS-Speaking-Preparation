Well, I would like to talk about my life in Shanghai last year while this city was completely locked down due to strict zero covid policy.

I could remember the date is the tenth of March when I got the news of the 14-day lockdown. Before I went back home, I went shopping and bought a lot of food that could support me to survive the following days. 

Afterwards, the lockdown became longer and longer. We were supposed to stay at home except to go out for covid testing. If anyone got a positive result, they and their neighbours would be transported and quarantined in hotels or camps. This is a terrible experience and made me feel hopeless and anxious. 

Due to the lack of exercise, I became more and more lazy. One day I found that I had gained almost 10 kilograms, which made me decide to take exercise. I did push-ups and pull-ups indoors, and sneaked downstairs at night to walk. To stay optimistic, I began to read every day. When I was immersed in a colourful drama, I would forget  the limitations in the real life. 

Finally,  on the first of June the lockdown was lifted. I rushed out on my bicycle that day and enjoyed the fresh air in the field. 

I still keep these habits today, and I could say that they help me to stay knowledgeable and healthy.

Well, I’d like to share one of my significant decisions I made last year. It’s to keep doing physical exercise/workouts every day. 

Due to the zero covid policy, Shanghai was completely locked down for 2 months, the most unfortunate of all is that the quarantine of my living place was for almost 3 months.

We were supposed to stay at home except to go out for covid testing. If anyone tested positive, they and their neighbours would be transported and quarantined in hotels or camps. That was a terrible experience and made me feel hopeless and anxious.

Due to the lack of exercise/activity, I became more and more lazy. One day I found that I had gained almost 10 kilograms/kilos, so I decided to start exercising. I did push-ups and pull-ups indoors, and sneaked downstairs to walk at night.

Then I became optimistic and energetic/full of energy. Until/Up to now, I have developed the habit of going to the gym and gradually lost weight. 

The aerobics could accelerate the metabolism, which benefits the heart and lung. 

After running in a sweat, I aways feel a sense of accomplishment. I also do the strength/weight training which could build more muscle and make me look fit and strong. 

So it’s a good decision I made and I 'm more confident that before.

I want to share a big decision I made last year - to exercise every day. 

Because of the zero covid policy, Shanghai was under complete lockdown for 2 months. Unfortunately, my living place was under quarantine for almost 3 months.

We were only allowed to leave for covid testing. 
 If someone tests positive for the virus, they and their neighbors may be taken to a hotel or camp for quarantine. This can be a frightening experience and left me feeling hopeless and anxious.

Because of the lack of activity, I became increasingly sedentary. One day, I realized that I had gained nearly 20 pounds, which led me to start exercising. I did push-ups and pull-ups inside my home and walked quietly downstairs at night.

I started feeling optimistic and full of energy. I developed a habit of going to the gym and have been gradually losing weight. 

Aerobics can speed up metabolism, which benefits the heart and lungs. After running, I always break a sweat and feel accomplished. Strength training can build muscle and give me a fit and strong appearance. 
It was a great decision to start exercising regularly.
