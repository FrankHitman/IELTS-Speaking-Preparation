Well, given the opportunity, I’d like to try swimming in the future because I want to overcome the fear of water I had when I was a child.
I plan to swim across the river in my hometown, which my older brother did long time ago. 

It’s a very wide river, and it’s a challenge for me. It especially reminds me of the experience of learning to swim.

During that time, my father tended to take me into the deepwater area and just let me paddle/struggle, but I always choked. But he always said that swallowing water is an inevitable part of learning to swim. It was a terrible experience for me.

By contrast, my brother had got this skill quickly and he even had tried to swim across the river with the help of many empty plastic bottles, which made me admired and envious. 

They used to make fun of me, saying that I was a dull boy.

Fortunately, I had learnt this skill from a swimming coach 5 years ago. It gave me confidence and I’d like to swim across the river as my brother did before. I want to prove myself that I can do it as well.

Well, I’d like to share my happy childhood in my hometown. There is a river near the village where my older brother, my friends and I were used to play during the summer vacation. Staying in the water was a good way to escape  the heat. 

We tried to learn swimming by ourself, but I was the dull one. I couldn’t swim too long because I didn’t know how to take a breath. 

By contrast, my brother quickly learnt how to swim and he even had tried to cross the river using empty plastic bottles, which made me admired. Sometime they arranged a swimming competition, I was glad to watch and cheer on the bank.

It is precious memory that I will cherish it all my life/forever. I still feel happy and proud when the vivid scene appears in my brain.

It was really hot and boring/dull to stay at home, so we were all eager/excited to meet/gather beside/by the river every afternoon. Sometime/Occasionally, we had to herd the cattle and the sheep on the grass. but then we would play poker in the shade of trees/ under the trees. The soft wind caressed our face, made us forget the pressure and anxiety of the study. 

It is precious memory that I will cherish it all my life/forever.

Well, I can say the memorable game may be learning to swim when I was a child, although I didn’t get this skill during that time. 

There is a very wide river near the village. I loved to play in the water for half the day with my friends and brother, especially during summer holidays. 
We tried to learn swimming by ourself, but I was the dull one. I couldn’t swim too long because I didn’t know how to take a breath. 
Sometime, my father would guide me, however he was not a good coach. When he took me into the deep water area and just left me there, I was nervous and always choked and swallowed water. But he always said that swallowing water is an inevitable part of learning to swim

In contrast, my brother got this skill quickly and had even tried to swim across the river with the help of many empty plastic bottles, which made me admired. Sometime, I watched them competing in the water.

It’s an unforgettable game for me. I still feel happy and proud when the vivid scene appears in my brain.
