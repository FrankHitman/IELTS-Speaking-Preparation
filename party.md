Well, I would like to talk about the party happened during Chinese New Year, which is the most important traditional festival. There are usually 7 days of holiday for reunion.

I still remember that last year I took 2 days off to go back to my hometown early before the holiday. It was a long trip for me to drive home, about 6 to 8 hours. Most of my parents and relatives lived in the hometown, so we all expected to see each other again. On that day, all my family members were busy with preparations. My brother and I were in charge of cleaning and decorating. My parents and sister-in-law were busy cooking in the kitchen. My little nephew was immersed in the joy of playing and watching TV programs. 

After setting off the firecrackers, the  lunch started in a lively atmosphere, and it was a great meal. We toasted each other with the blessing of "Happy New Year" and "Wish you rich". I know It is funny that every Chinese people loves money and good fortune. In the following days, we visited our friends and relatives with New Year gifts and blessing.

This is our only chance to meet each other every year, and we are all looking forward to having the good time together.

Well, the cook I would like to talk about is my mother. Cooking is her  daily routine. I was used to the traditional Chinese food she made everyday when I was young. She is good at making noodles, dumplings and soup.  Now she lives with my brother, so I have little chance to taste her cooking. But I can remember that last year she made a big meal on the day of Chinese New Year.

On that day, all my family members were busy with the preparations. My brother and I were cleaning and decorating the rooms. My mother and sister-in-law were in charge of cooking in the kitchen. My little nephew was immersed in the joy of playing and watching TV programs. 

After firecrackers were lit, the  lunch started in a lively atmosphere, and it was a great meal. There were 8 delicious dishes, including chicken, beef and a fish meat, which worked up our appetites. We toasted each other with blessings of "Happy New Year" and "Wish you rich". 

Now, My mother always tells me not to eat outside because of the unclean/dirty/unhygienic conditions in the restaurants. Sometimes I make breakfast for myself, but I prefer going to restaurants for convenience.

Well, I would like to talk about the Chinese New Year Day, which is the most important traditional festival. There are usually 7 days of holiday for reunion. No matter how busy we are and how far away we are, we incline to get together every year. Most of our parents and relatives live in the hometown, so we all expect to see each other again during the vacation.

I still remember that last year I took 2 days off to go back to my hometown early before the holiday. It was a long trip for me to drive home, about 6 to 8 hours.
