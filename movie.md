Well, I have been busy for preparing for the IELTS test recently, so I have had little chance to enjoy a film. However, I’d like to talk about a movie called "Someone to Talk to". I watched it on the online streaming platform a long time ago . It’s about how a man and a woman fell in love and got married at the beginning, but ended up separating due to family conflicts.

In terms of why I decided to watch it, it’s because the movie was adapted from a novel that I had read before. It is not as good as the book, because it lost a lot of details from the original such as it didn’t tell the audience about story of the daughter after she grew up.  The storyline/plot wasn’t very realistic either. For example, the wife worked in a factory and earned only 3000 a month, but she’s willing to buy her daughter a down jacket/coat that costed hundreds of RMB. In real life when I was young, my parents preferred to save the money for my education rather than  buy a expensive new cloths. For a poor family, they tend to lead a plain and hardworking life. However, it’s good at telling us an important thing, it’s hard to find someone who could understand you, if found, we should cherish.
