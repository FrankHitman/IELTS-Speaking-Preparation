Well I would like to talk about Lang Ping who is a former volleyball player and coach.

As a player, she was a member of the Chinese national team and the team won the gold medal during the Olympic Games held in the USA. Although she was a champion, she continued to train hard and compete in upcoming games. Due to her good performance and determination, she got a nickname "Tie Lang Tou", which means "Iron Hammer". 

It’s interesting that she worked as a coach in several teams from different countries, including Italy, the USA, and China. All of the teams got excellent results in many matches under her guidance. One of the controversial events was that she coached US team to defeat the Chinese team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. (You know, China is her home country.) Consequently, there was some criticisms about her such as "she is not patriotic", but she didn’t mind and continued working as normal. I was impressed by her professionalism. A few years later, she returned to coach the Chinese national team and also did a great job. 

In my daily work and life, whenever I face some misunderstanding and want to give up, I would think of Lang Ping’s story and try my best to keep going.
