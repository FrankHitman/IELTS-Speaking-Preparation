理想房子 将来时
Describe the ideal house you would like to have
Where it would be
What it would look like
What special features it would have
And explain why it would be your ideal house
```

Well, Given the opportunity, I’d like to live in a big house in my (rural) hometown. My hometown is a rural place where the the prices of estate are affordable. The house doesn’t have to be extravagant/fancy/luxury/luxurious but should have a spacious courtyard with trees and flowers.  I can lie in the yard and enjoy the sunbathing in winter.

The internet speed should be good enough for me to work remotely without the worrying about  being late. 

The environment should be quiet every day, so that I can wake up to the singing of birds every morning. The air should be fresh without pollution.
Additionally, I want an agricultural field where I can grow vegetables and fruits for daily consuming. 
If possible, I will raise/keep a dog and a cat. With their company, I will not feel lonely. 
One more thing, I need a car to buy weekly needs/necessities from the supermarkets in town. 

Since I do not have excessive material demands/needs, I would not face too much pressure and be happy every day.

Now, I’m living in Shanghai, but I’m a bit tired/exhausted of the fast-paced and depressing city life. I’m looking forward to a comfortable and less stressful environment.

Currently, I reside in Shanghai, but I feel exhausted and demoralized by the rapid and disheartening city life. I anticipate relocating in the future to a different location.
