Well, I would like to talk about my shopping experience in the evening of the eleventh of November. It is popular online Shopping Festival in China, called the Double Eleventh Day. It starts at midnight with big discounts on a variety of goods. We celebrate it annually.

Last November, I prepared for the activity by adding items into my online cart, prepaying for some goods, and searching for e-coupons/coupons. I waited all night until 12 a.m. for the significant price cuts. As soon as the sale began, I quickly placed my orders to save a substantial/large/considerable amount of money. 

The savings made me extremely thrilled/excited and content/satisfied. However, I struggled to fall asleep afterwards. Consequently/As a result, I felt tired/exhausted the next day and could not concentrate/focus on my work efficiently.

Well, this was an unforgettable experience for me. I learned/figured out that the discount is not free, it also costs your energy and efficiency.

Now I still try to get a big discount before I hit the "Order" button. But I also learned/figured out that the discount is not free, it also costs your energy and efficiency.

I remember that the last time we celebrated this festival I prepared many good luck gifts.

I followed this activity for many days in advance, including adding the desired items to the e-carts, depositing for some prepaid goods, and looking for e-coupons.
The biggest discounts were not released until 0 clock, so I waited patiently all night. Once the time came, I completed the orders as quickly as possible.
I felt excited and happy because of saving a lot of money.
 I could not fall asleep as fast as usual that night
