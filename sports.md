Well, I’d love to watch billiards games on my phone, including snooker and eight-ball. There is a famous snooker player named Ding JunHui in my country. I enjoy his games a lot because I’m interested in it and play it with my friends every day. Sometimes, I’d like to share his instructional videos with my friends and apply the skills/techniques during the game.

There is a billiards table next to my office. My co-workers and I gather there to play after meal on workdays. I feel that I have made great progress since the first time I picked up the cue stick. 

In terms of the reason, I would say it helps me to make progress with playing billiards. At first, I was not quite good at control and always miscued/missed. However, after I watched the replay of Ding JunHui’s games, I tried to imitate his shooting stance, including lowering the head on stick, aiming at the cue ball. Fortunately, the the effect was obvious/clear. I could find out the best angle to shoot and win against some of the opponents who I used to lose against. 

Apart from improving skill, I make a lot of new friends during the process, which enrich my life every day.

Eight-ball (also spelled 8-ball or eightball, and sometimes called solids and stripes, spots and stripes[1] or rarely highs and lows) is a discipline of pool played on a billiard table with six pockets, cue sticks, and sixteen billiard balls (a cue ball and fifteen object balls). The object balls include seven solid-colored balls numbered 1 through 7, seven striped balls numbered 9 through 15, and the black 8 ball. After the balls are scattered with a break shot, a player is assigned either the group of solid or striped balls once they have legally pocketed a ball from that group. The object of the game is to legally pocket the 8-ball in a "called" pocket, which can only be done after all of the balls from a player's assigned group have been cleared from the table.
The game is the most frequently played discipline of pool, and is often thought of as synonymous with "pool". The game has numerous variations, mostly regional. It is the second most played professional pool game, after nine-ball, and for the last several decades ahead of straight pool.[2]
