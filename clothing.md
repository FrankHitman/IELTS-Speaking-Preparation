# Speaking Clothing
```
喜欢穿的衣服
Describe a piece of clothing you enjoy wearing
What it is like
When and where you got it
How often you wear it
And explain why you enjoy wearing it
```

Well, I’m not particular/picky about clothing and don’t have a good sense of fashion, if I had to choose one type, I would pick sports clothes, because they are comfy and easy to move. 

I put on/wear sports clothing nearly/almost every day, even when I went to have an interview. Of course, in winter I have to wear down coat and pants to keep warm.

I love workouts and go to the gym every day. I find that sporting clothing is breathable and quick-drying, which is good for physical exercise especially when I’m in a sweat. If I put on other types of dress, I would feel constrained/uncomfortable. Another reason I love them is sports clothes are easy to wash and are also of great quality. I don’t need to pay more attention on how to maintain them. Finally, I bought most of them at/from Sporting Store, such as Decathlon. They are sometimes on sale, so they are affordable for me.

So, in order to keep fit, I love sport and the sporting clothing.

Well, I’d like to talk about a new sporting shop/store opened recently. It is a chain of Decathlon stores located in a shopping mall, which is not very far from my home. I used to go there by bike. 

We can buy sports clothes, shoes, bikes and equipment there. I’m a big fan of sport and love shopping there. Last time, the tyre of my bike burst/broken and they help me to fix it with affordable price. 
It is popular among sports fans, including children. because it offer fitting rooms and area to try on equipment, so it is convenient for consumers/customers to select and buy. 

The staff are very nice/friendly and helpful, they would resolve the problems quickly, even when customers want to refund the money by returning the goods.

Occasionally, there are discounts available on clothing, the clothes are easy to wash and are also of great quality. We don’t need to pay more attention on how to maintain them.

I think it is good retailer, and their business would be as good as ever.
