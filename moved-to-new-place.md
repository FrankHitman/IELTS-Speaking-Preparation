Well, shifting has become easy these days due to the facilities of the transportation system. I’d like to share the relocation experience of my friends, Wang Shan.

His workplace was in the central area of Shanghai and his rent is expensive because his living area wasn’t far from the company. Fortunately, his boss had decided to move the office to the suburbs to cut down/reduce the daily cost/expenses. So he had to find a new apartment to live around his new office. He asked me to help him with my car on the weekend. Some of the boxes were too heavy to carry, we worked in a sweat.

The new rooms is more spacious than before, but the price is cheaper. The surroundings/environment is pretty good as well  because the grocery store is downstairs and there is a park and a river nearby. It is convenient for him to shop for daily needs and find a pleasure. To celebrate, we had dinner together. He paid, of course.

In terms of the impact on me, I think it may cost me more time on the road to meet him.
