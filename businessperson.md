As far as I know, one of the successful businessperson is Jack Ma, who is the founder of Alibaba Group.

When I was in college, there was a new way of shopping called e-commerce. One of the famous websites was 'TaoBao' which I used frequently. It was a project launched by Jack’s company. At that time, I started to notice this man and I’m quite interested in his story. I watched his interviews and speeches.

In terms of the development of the company, at first, the transactions on this platform could only be done by cash on delivery, making it less competitive. Then they released a new product called Alipay, a third-party online payment platform. The money that consumers pay online is temporarily held by platform and is refundable. This made online transactions more convenient and trustworthy for both sellers and buyers. Fortunately, this boosted the company’s development and attracted more and more users. With the new popularity of smartphones, Jack expanded his services from PC to mobile area, releasing relevant applications, making people more addicted to his services. As a result, Alibaba went public in 2014, making Jack Ma a successful businessman.

He is still good at managing his companies now.
