# IELTS-Speaking-Preparation
## Introduction
From August to September 2023, I was busy preparing the IELTS test. 
This repository is intended to record the speaking scripts that I wrote in 10 days.
It was a hardworking period, and I don't think I prepared pretty well. 
Because there were only 2 weeks left before the test day, when I realized I was not ready for part 2 of speaking, 
especially when I was given a topic that I was not familiar.
As a result, I collected the updating topics on IELTS-Bro website, and commenced making up stories and writing down.
Although there were almost 50 topics, I found that some topics are related to each other, 
and I did not have to remember 50 different stories. 
I finished the scripts of part 3 just a few days before the deadline,
so I had no time to prepare the part 3. 
Unfortunately, I only get band 5 in the test, even though I had mock test with the foreign English teacher every week.
In case of I will attend this test in the future, I transcribe these materials in github.
