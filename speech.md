Well, I’d like to talk about one of my speeches when I shared the techniques of using a programming language with my colleagues, It’s about how to use the Python language smartly/efficiently. 

I’m a software developer, and lack of the opportunity of speaking in front of a group of people. So the team leader decided to arrange a rotating technology sharing sessions monthly. When it was my turn, I prepared the outline and scripts in advance. 

In terms of the reason, I can say I’m familiar with the Python language and it’s an effective and efficient language in programming. There is a saying "Life is short, I use Python". At the beginning, I was a little nervous and my voice was a little shaky. But as the presentation went on, I got the rhythm and became more confident. At the end, I provided the audience with a chance to ask questions, and I explained them in detail.

It was a successful address and a meaningful experience for me because I feel a sense of achievement through the process. I’m willing to participate in more relevant activities in the future.

Well, I’d like to talk about the speech when I shared the techniques of using a programming language with my colleagues this year. It’s about how to use the Python language smartly/efficiently. 

I’m a software developer, and lack of the opportunity of speaking in front of a group of people. So the team leader decided to arrange a rotating technology sharing sessions monthly. When the month of my turn was coming, I prepared the outline of my scripts with code and graph in advance. 

In terms of the reason, I can say I’m familiar with the Python language and it’s an effective and efficient language in programming. There is a saying "Life is short, I use Python". At the beginning, I was a little nervous and my voice was a little shaky. But as the address went on, I got the rhythm and became more confident. At the end, I provided the audience with a chance to ask questions, and I explained them in detail.

It was a successful lecture and a meaningful experience for me. I’m willing to participate in more relevant activities.

Well, I don’t think there is a universal standard/measure of success. In my opinion, it could be to live a decent and happy life. Then I’d like to talk about my friend, Wong Shan, who has a good sense of humour. We were classmates in high school. Now he is a software programmer.

He is good at making jokes that make everybody laugh. That’s why I like to chat with him. In school, he was interested in computers and would like to find some relevant books to read. Then he was willing to share some knowledge with us. As his will, he is doing ideal job and earning considerable salary.  

Once, he gave me a practical advice to solve my lagging computer problem with a lower cost. I wanted to buy a new laptop, but he suggested to replace the hard disk drive with a solid state drive.

I learned from him how to stay optimistic, and I also know that we can make money without the cost of happiness if we do what we love.
