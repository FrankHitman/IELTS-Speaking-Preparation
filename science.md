Well, I would like to talk about AI, the abbreviation of artificial intelligence, which is popular now.

The first time I heard this word was when I was watching a discussion between Jack Ma and Elon Musk. Jack said that AI represents love in Chinese and that sounded funny to me. Then he argued that "there is no need to worry about the threat from machines, because humans created machines, and humans are more creative than machines". But Elon put forth the opposite. 

After that, I searched for some relevant information about AI. Later, I felt a bit pessimistic about the future of human beings because we couldn’t compete with AI in some areas, such as simple and repetitive work. 

Last year, ChatGPT was released and became popular all over the world. It could generate readable and logical digital content, not only in one language, but also in many other languages. People can chat with it and get integrated information. Someone even used it to learn a foreign language. All these features made people realize that large language models had entered a new generation. We can predict that some human jobs may be replaced by machines in the future. 

This issue is full of conflicts and people need to deal with it carefully. What ordinary people could do is to be more professional and creative in our work. No one wants to lose their job in the future.
We must learn how to control the AI in case of the disaster like the movie of "Terminator"
