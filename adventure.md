Well, Given the opportunity, I’d love to go to tibet by myself. This destination has been existed in my mind for many years.

Tibet is the famous tourist place in the world with so many magnificent/beautiful/stunning mountains and rivers.
I will drive on the highway 318 from Chengdu to Lhasa, because this route is famous in the Internet. I’m going to take/pack enough water and food in case I can’t find a hotel on the trip. On the way, I plan to take many photos whenever I encounter a remarkable scene/landscape. It would be a long time trip/journey so I won’t hurry/rush.

In terms of the reason, I think it is inspired/motivated by my former colleague.
Currently, he has resigned and is cycling from Chengdu to Lhasa. He has posted so many amazing photos about his journey on social media such as the clear river/lake, winding road, local special food, and lofty/towering mountains. 

In conclusion, it would be an amazing trip. I’m saving money and looking forward to it.

There was a special picture showing an handwritten slogan which said - You might regret it for a month if you come, but you would regret it for the rest of your life if you don’t. 

I’m stuck in daily work for living and don’t have the courage to quit. Without experiencing the diverse world, we might feel that life is boring/dull, even meaningless. So, given that opportunity, I’d step out for my dream tour/journey.

The capital of Tibet is Lhasa, and there are so many vlogs and routes about how to tour to Lhasa, including by car, by bike and  on foot. One of the famous route is called highway 318.

Well, I’m going to talk about a tour to HuBei Province by car with my friends. It was a five-day round trip that happened 3 years ago during the National Day Holiday. 
The reason why we chose to travel during that time was because the highway and the scenic spots were all free.
In order to prevent/avoid tired driving, we had a rest in the service areas every 2 hours and took turns driving. After almost 10 hours driving/hurrying, we arrived at the first resort area, WuDang Mountains. At that night, we had a barbecue and checked in a hotel. 
Unfortunately, the next morning it rained heavily and became colder.  We had to buy raincoats and boots. It was uncomfortable and inconvenient for us to climb the mountain. However when reached the top, the landscape was spectacular, the peaks were hidden and emerged in the mist/fog. That’s spectacular landscape. We took numerous photos for each other with the scene.

We visited the campus of my friend and tasted the local special food nearby.
In the following days, we went to another famous resort, ShenNongJia, and had a quiet night in the village. The village was embraced by mountains, and the air was super fresh. 

On the way back, we encountered several traffic congestion/jams, which costed us more time than before, so we were tired after getting home. 

It’s an amazing journey for me and I won’t forget it in my life. I recommend everyone to have a look
