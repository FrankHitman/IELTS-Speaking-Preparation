Well, I would like to talk about my old laptop. I bought it 10 years ago when I got my first month‘s salary after graduation. It is so heavy and hot when running.

One day in the past, I noticed that there were some files denying access, and the response time of some programs was too long to wait. At first, I did not take it seriously. Unfortunately, when I pressed down the power button one morning, it stuck in boot screen . I thought it had run out of battery power, but I made sure that the adapter was plugged in tightly. I was a little worried because some important data was stored in it. 

Then, I searched the internet with the error code through my phone. Luckily, someone had discussed this problem on BBS, and the top answers recommended replacing the hard disk drive. So, I ordered a new SSD and a portable drive enclosure online. The packages arrived the next day. I managed to replace the drive and install the operating system with the online tutorials. Finally, I backed up the data from the old drive with the enclosure.

It is a useful experience for me and gives me a sense of achievement/accomplishment because I learned a new skill through this process.

Well, I would like to talk about a practical advice I gave to one of my friends, Wong Shan.

Last year we met to go hiking together one weekend. During the conversation, he complained about his lagging laptop and he was planning to buy a new one. After some inquiry, I recommended him to buy a solid state drive as a replacement instead of buying a new one. In terms of reasons, first of all, his old laptop was equipped with a hard disk drive which was the bottleneck of the computer’s performance. Secondly, SSD is faster than HDD and compatible with his device. Last but not least, SSD is cheaper than a new computer, which would save him a lot of money.

Then he followed my advice and ordered a new drive and a portable drive enclosure online and we kept in touch in the late days. When he asked for some tutorials on how to repair and install the operating system, I sent him some links that I found on Google. Finally, his laptop lit up and became faster, he backed up his data from the old drive to the new one with the drive enclosure.

I was glad he took my advice, and my method solved his problem.

Well I would like to talk about how I repaired my laptop when it crashed during work time. 

One day in the past, I noticed that some files couldn’t be opened, and some programs became too slow to operate. At first, I did not take it seriously. Unfortunately, when I tried to turn it on one morning, it got stuck in a boot loop. I tried multiple times but it didn’t work. I thought it might have run out of battery power, but I made sure that the adapter was plugged in sockets securely. I was concerned because I had some valuable data saved in it, so I searched online with the error code using my phone. Fortunately, some users had discussed this problem on BBS, and they recommended to replace the hard disk drive, so I ordered a new SSD and a portable drive enclosure from an app. The packages arrived the next day. I managed to replace the drive and install the operating system, with the help of some online guides. Then, I plugged the drive into the enclosure and backed up the data from the old drive to the new one.

It is a useful experience for me and gives me a sense of achievement/accomplishment because I gained a new skill through this process.

Well, I would like to talk about one of my friends, Wong Shan, who can come up with some good ideas. We were classmates in high school. He is now a software programmer.

I remember last time he gave me a practical advice which saved me a lot of money. On that day, we met in the park. During we were walking, I complained about my lagging laptop, and was planning to buy a new one. After some research, he recommended me that I should buy a solid state drive as a replacement instead of buying a new one. He explained that the hard disk drive was the bottleneck of the computer’s performance. Furthermore, SSD is faster than HDD and compatible with the device. And the most important is that SSD is cheaper than a new computer.

Then I followed his ideas and ordered a new drive and a portable drive enclosure online and I kept in touch with him in the following days. When I asked for some tutorials on how to repair and install the operating system, he sent me some links and videos. Finally, my laptop became faster, and I backed up the data from the old drive with the drive enclosure.

I was glad I took his ideas because his method solved my problem and saved me a lot of money.

Well, I would like to talk about the significant rule at work that is "details matter". Even small oversights can have a big consequence. I can say that last time due to my carelessness, I almost lost my data in my computer and couldn’t focus on work for 2 days.

One day in the past, I noticed that some files on computer couldn’t be opened, and some programs became too slow to operate. At first, I did not take it seriously. Unfortunately, when I tried to turn it on one morning, it got stuck in a boot loop. Despite multiple attempts it failed to reboot. I thought it might have run out of battery power, but I made sure that the adapter was plugged in sockets securely. I was concerned because I had some valuable data saved in it, so I searched online with the error code using my phone. Fortunately, some users had discussed this problem on BBS, and they recommended to replace the hard disk drive, so I ordered a new SSD and a portable drive enclosure online. The packages arrived the next day. With the help of some online tutorials, I managed to replace the drive and install the operating system. Then, I backed up the data from the old drive with the enclosure.

It was a tough lesson I learnt, but the good thing is that the data wasn’t lost in the end.

If we overlook some crucial details, we might pay much later. 
We should follow the rules which could avoid making mistakes.

Well, I would like to talk about a helpful online commercial that solved my laptop’s performance problem. It was advertising a solid-state drive which promoted by an internet celebrity. The ad demonstrated how their product could boost the performance by replacing the hard-disk drive . 

Last year, I noticed that my laptop became lagging and and some programs became too slow to operate. At first, I did not take it seriously. Unfortunately, when I tried to turn it on one morning, it got stuck in a boot loop. Despite multiple attempts it failed to reboot. I was worried because I had some valuable data saved on it, so I searched online and happened to find this advertising. It recommended to replace the hard disk drive with their products. Then I followed the advice and ordered a new SSD and a portable drive enclosure in their shop. The packages arrived the next day. With the help of some their tutorials, I managed to replace the drive and install the operating system. Then, I use the enclosure to backed up the data from the old drive.

It was a useful advertisement I have seen because it was an affordable solution for me.  I'm grateful that I didn't lose any of the data.

Well, I would like to buy a new laptop for myself in a few months. I had an old one now which is almost 10 years old. I brought it using my first month‘s salary after graduation. It is so heavy and hot when running. In terms of why I want to buy a new one, it was a long story.

One day in the past, I noticed that there were some files denying access, and the response time of some programs was too long to wait. At first, I did not take it seriously. Unfortunately, when I pressed down the power button one morning, it looped in dark and boot screen . I thought it had run out of battery power, but I made sure that the adapter was plugged in tightly. I was a little worried because some important data was stored in it. Then, I searched the internet with the error code shown on the screen through my phone. Luckily, some people had discussed this problem on BBS, and the top answers recommended replacing the hard disk drive. So, I ordered a new one and a portable drive enclosure online. The packages arrived the next day. I managed to replace the drive and install the operating system, with the help of tutorials on Google. Finally, I plugged the drive into the enclosure and backed up the data from the old drive to the new one.

Although this problem was solved, I still worry it will happen again, so I will buy a brand new one in the future.
