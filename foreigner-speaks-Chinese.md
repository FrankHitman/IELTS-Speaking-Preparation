Well, I would like to talk about Rowswell whose Chinese stage name is "Da Shan". I’m more familiar with his Chinese name because when I watched his talkshows in Chinese on TV he introduced himself as Da Shan.

As far as I know, he is a Canadian and came to China many years ago. His fluency of Mandarin is pretty good. I don’t know that how he mastered it, it might be the factors of interest and early exposure to Chinese when he was young, and the language environment when he came to China, or the charm of Chinese culture. He even tried to study xiangsheng from a comedian, Jiang Kun. You known, Xiangsheng is a Chinese form of stand-up. It is quite hard to master even for a native speaker, so we can imagine the difficulties he was facing during that period. However, his efforts paid off in the end. His xiangsheng shows were popular in China, and he even performed on the stage of CCTV. I couldn’t recall the specifics of his performances, but I can remember his voice.

So I guess the best way to acquire a second language is to keep practising  and challenging ourselves. We can improve by learning from our mistakes

Now, I’m learning English and want to be a bilingual person. From DaShan’s story I believe the best way to acquire a second language is to keep practising  and challenging ourselves. We can improve by learning from our mistakes

Well, Given the opportunity, I’d like to talk with Rowswell. I want to know how he mastered a second language because I’m studying English now and feel a bit of frustrated. His Chinese stage name is "Da Shan". I’m more familiar with his Chinese name because when I watched his talkshows on TV he introduced himself as Da Shan. If I were given a chance to talk with him, I would ask him for advice on mastering another language.

As far as I know, he is a Canadian and came to China many years ago. His fluency of Mandarin is pretty good. He even tried to study xiangsheng from a comedian, Jiang Kun.

Well, I would like to talk about Rowswell whose Chinese stage name is "Da Shan". He is a popular celebrity in China because he is the first foreigner who performed XiangSheng pretty well on the stage of CCTV. You known, Xiangsheng is a Chinese form of stand-up comedy. He worked as a cultural ambassador between China and the West in the past.

As far as I know, he is a Canadian and came to China many years ago. His fluency of Mandarin is pretty good. He even tried to study xiangsheng from a comedian, Jiang Kun.  It is quite hard to master even for a native speaker, so we can imagine the difficulties he was facing during that period. However, his efforts paid off in the end. His xiangsheng shows were popular in China. When he appeared on stage with his master, my family and I all cheered for them and amused by their sense of humor. I couldn’t recall the specifics of his performances, but I can remember his voice.
