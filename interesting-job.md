Well, I can say I’m satisfied with my current job, working as a programmer. It is suitable for me because I’m an introverted person and I’m not good at managing interpersonal relationships and speaking in front of a group of people. If I were to stand on a stage and give a speech, I would feel awkward and nervous. 

By contrast, dealing with the computer problem and writing code is my favour. It’s a cup of tea for me to find out the bug of the program/software.

I incline to land a job online, the employers would add job description and techniques requirement in detail. I would send my resume to the potential company. They might contact me and arrange an interview for me later. It’s convenient for us to find each other. It requires employees to be professional at specific programming language and to have good sense of logic. Sometimes, I would learn new trend and knowledge from the feedback of interview.
