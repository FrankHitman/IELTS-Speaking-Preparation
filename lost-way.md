# Speaking Lost Way

And explain how you found your way

Well, I have a good sense of direction, even if I go to a strange place I can still find a way out by my phone. However, I can tell you that a story about my mother when she got lost.

She has bad sense of direction especially in an unfamiliar environment, and she is illiterate. 

A few years ago, she came to Shanghai, living with my elder brother. One morning, my brother called me and told me that she had got lost and couldn’t tell him her location on the phone due to she could not read the street sign and the name of the building. We got nervous at that moment. Fortunately, I thought of her smartphone had the "Find My Phone" function/feature. I bought her the phone, and had created a cloud account on the phone. Then I signed in/logged into the cloud website on my computer, and located her position and told it to my brother. You can’t believe that she was not too far from my brother’s workplace. Finally, my brother found her successfully.

Luckily, that my mother carried the smartphone with her. Technology is amazing, isn’t it?

Well, I’d like to talk about the invention of smartphone. it is common that nearly everyone has a device, even teenagers at school. 
We can use them to navigate to a destination, purchase or sell something online, chat with others, watch videos, enjoy/listen to music, and obtain the information and knowledge.
Although they are rich in functions/features, they are affordable for most people. They have become the necessity of our life, They are easy to use with user-friendly interface, even for the elderly. Once my mother got lost, I used her mobile phone to find her location. The function is called "Find My Phone". I logged into the cloud website to locate the smartphone.
However, convenience comes at the cost of privacy. There are some new threats from cyber-attacks and data leakage. Sometime, the private data might be used to market to us or restrict our personal freedom such as Covid control policy

So it is a useful invention/innovation that improves the standard of living, but we need to pay attention to privacy protection as well.
